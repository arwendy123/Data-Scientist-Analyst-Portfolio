**Results:**
The project resulted in valuable insights into the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of light-duty vehicles in Canada. Through exploratory data analysis and the development of a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, the project shed light on the factors influencing fuel efficiency and emissions. Visualizations provided clear representations of variable distributions and correlations. The SVR model allowed for accurate predictions of fuel consumption and emissions based on relevant features. Model evaluation using metrics such as mean squared error and R2 score ensured the model's performance. Overall, the project enhanced understanding of the relationship between vehicle features, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions, providing useful information for stakeholders in making decisions related to the efficiency and environmental impact of light-duty vehicles.
